                                    <li>My team and I are responsible for the continuous delivery of a secure, robust and modern cloud platform. I achieve this by exploiting modern DevSecOps practices through the extensive use of Infrastructure as Code and CI/CD pipelines.</li>
                                    <li>I utilise ITIL practices and the ServiceNow platform to effectively respond to and assist application teams who require assistance with the platform, as well as to provide timely resolutions to Incidents and Problems that may arise. This includes raising Change Requests as appropriate.</li>
                                    <li>In addition to the BAU platform management, I have been involved in the delivery of several high-value projects for the organisation. Recently, those have included:</li>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li><strong>The migration from GitLab to Azure DevOps.</strong> This included setting up new self-hosted build agents, proxy servers, Docker build servers and hosts as well as decommissioning the old product. Additionally, over 300 pipelines had to be migrated from GitLab syntax to Azure Pipelines. 900 Git repositories were also migrated, containing Terraform files relating to the roles, policies and infrastructure for most of AWS for the organisation at a platform level.</li>
                                            <li><strong>The development of Single Sign-On for AWS</strong> within the organisation. This has included the development of all new permission sets for platform roles and application team roles as well as the designing of new patterns that have scalability and security at front of mind. This solution involves integrating AWS IAM Identity Center with Microsoft Entra ID. To assist, I have also developed several bespoke Python scripts (some which are multi-threaded), including one which has generated 800+ Terraform files, saving hundreds of manual hours, and others which use the AWS boto3 API to centrally gather information about the organisation’s cloud resources and policies, to assist in critical decision-making.</li>
                                            <li><strong>The implementation of a new security analysis tool, Trivy.</strong> I have developed a bespoke Docker container image which embeds the Terraform binary and Trivy into a single container image which is used by most of our pipelines. Trivy scans all our Dockerfiles, Terraform files and Python scripts for misconfiguration errors, bugs and security issues or known vulnerabilities. The implementation allowed us to address previously unknown misconfiguration errors.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    <li>I also maintain a set of bespoke CloudWatch dashboards which are primarily used for measuring the performance and health of the links between AWS and two on-prem data centres, as well as between the organisation's AWS and Azure tenancies.</li>
                                    <li>Some of the CloudWatch work was done in support of a recent upgrade of the DirectConnect links from IPsec to MACsec, improving not only available bandwidth, but also security and reliability. This project required close co-ordination with AWS, internal stakeholders and colleagues at MacGov.</li>
                                    <li>Some of my other job tasks include:</li>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Monitoring internal infrastructure expenditure and performance using cloud-native tools such as AWS Cost Explorer, Compute Optimizer and Cost Optimization Hub.</li>
                                            <li>Maintaining, managing and deploying a suite of Docker container images for internal tooling as well as consumption by app teams (Debian base images, AWS CLI, Terraform and Python images, as well as JDK and .NET).</li>
                                            <li>Monitoring and addressing AWS Security Hub findings.</li>
                                            <li>Maintaining a static, highly available 'down for maintenance' page (maintenance.ato.gov.au) for use by multiple application teams, using AWS CloudFront and Certificate Manager.</li>
                                            <li>Managing work backlog items and tasks in Azure DevOps and planning work and projects using Agile project management methodology.</li>
                                            <li>Deploying infrastructure using VMware's vRealize Automation (vRA).</li>
                                        </ul>

                                <p>My primary role as a sessional academic is teaching web development across three units: IAB207 (AQF Level 7), IFN557 (AQF Levels 8-9, now retired), and IFN582 (AQF Levels 8-9). These units focus on equipping students with practical skills in full-stack web application development, using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework. Core technologies include Python Flask for the controller, HTML/CSS with Bootstrap for the view, and SQLite or MySQL for the model. The curriculum also covers Agile software development principles, version control with Git/GitHub, and responsive design best practices. I was also responsible for the development and maintenance of the <a href="https://github.com/IAB207-QUT?tab=repositories">example code</a> used in some of those units.</p>
